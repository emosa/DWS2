<h2>Barrel Reserve Chardonnay</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Our Chardonnay Barrel Reserve is delivered from extraordinarily chosen bunches of grapes from our best cultivators. The grapes are pressed and exchanged to oak barrels where we age and adult the wine to make the extraordinary unpredictability that just barrel maturing can accomplish. This wine will combine well with rich smooth dishes, flame broiled poultry or fish, and it is particularly great with lobster, crab, or shrimp. We ensure a smooth round taste with subtle oak nuances.</p>
